                <span class="text-body-secondary">Perhaps, He was!</span></h2>
              <p class="lead">His life is consumed with the pursuit of money, power and political status.
                 This psychotic obsession for wealth shows little sign of conscience or mercy.
                  He enjoys flaunting his fortunes and victories in the face of fellow lanista and hated competitor
                  (and once-close friend and confidant) Marcus Decius Solonius, no matter how small his successes may be.
                  His frequent plots and schemes to gain social standing seem to have no limits, including the
                   kidnapping and murder of the magistrate Titus Calavius and the framing of it upon Solonius.</p>

              <span class="text-body-secondary">Poor Thing! Rare Marvel!</span></h2>
            <p class="lead">Lucretia is a fairly conflicted character with great depths of both love and deception.
               On one hand, she adores her husband and his endeavors for greatness. Concerned with the business and social affairs of 
               her husband, she likes to work with 
                him as a partneution or advice, but she has a few times displayed shock at the lengths her husband has gone to advance 
                their social status. Such acts include the slaughter of a child along with a man plotting to kill her husband, where
                 she expresses disgust at the act. However, she does not let this hinder her emotions towards her husband and ultimately 
                 accepts his actions as a necessary evil.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Gaia's unfortunate demise. 
            <span class="text-body-secondary">Death itself was enamoured with her!</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Gaia is a manipulative, adventurous individual.When she has a goal in sight, Gaia will charm and 
            manipulate those around her to achieve these goals. Despite this, she is honest and caring towards Lucretia and
             wishes to help and protect her, but she does not discount the option of furthering her own goals (like finding a husband)
              at the same time. She wants to marry a rich man and is constantly on the lookout.

            Even though Gaia has many contacts and friends amongst the Roman and Capuan societies, it appears that the only person
             she genuinely cares about other than herself is Lucretia, and she puts herself at risk for her sake.
